# DeepRS
This repository was transferred from our protected internal repository, which here is named *DeepRS_pro*.     
I will share many experiences of industrial deep-learning-based remote sensing imagery processing here, and some necessary, simple, and efficient remote sensing processing programs with deep learning are provided in this repository. Of course, demonstrations of our work will be exhibited vividly as possible as I can :).  
If there is any commercial application requirement, please contact me through e-mail: dymwan@gmail.com.  
You can just focus on the subfolder *demos* for more details.
