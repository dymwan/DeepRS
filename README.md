# DeepRS
This repository was selectively migrated from our protected internal repository, which there is named *DeepRS_pro*.     
I will share many experiences of industrial deep-learning-based remote sensing imagery processing here, and some necessary, simple, and efficient remote sensing processing programs with deep learning are provided in this repository. Of course, demonstrations of our work will be exhibited vividly as possible as I can ðŸ˜Š.  
You can just focus on the subfolder ```./DeepRS/demos``` for more details.
